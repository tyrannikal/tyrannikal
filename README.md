## Howdy

I'm returning to software engineering after many years away. C/C++ and Java were my home before, and I'd like to respark that. However, since I'm a noob again anyway I might as well try something new too, so I'm learning Python then Go. Also trying to build the habit and experience with more fully implementing the power of ten rules for safety critical code. Losing recursion makes me kinda sad, but the benefits of foregoing it regretfully appear to outweigh its use. Shame but in the end the methodology has so far shown to be effective in producing more reliable code, spending less time debugging, and sleeping better at night 💤.


**Currently working on:** *Asteroids (Python)*

**Currently reading:** *Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions (Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths)*
